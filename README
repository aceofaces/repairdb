Inventory and device repair tracking webapp by Tony Harmelink

This is a quickly hacked together webapp to track inventory and repairs in a depot setting.
My first attempt at a RoR application. Built using the Hobo rapid prototyping framework.
Originally designed for Mix & Burn.

Software is provided as is. I provide no support or warranty.
